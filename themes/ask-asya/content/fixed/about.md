<p class="message">
My name is Asya Kamsky and work with and for MongoDB.

I've got many sites on the web that I contribute to, this is one where I'm
publishing many questions and answers about MongoDB that come up on mailing lists, Google Groups, Stackoverflow, and live discussions.  

If you have a question you'd like me to answer, feel free to e-mail it to asya@mongodb.com and I will try to get to it soon.  I will tend to answer questions that others are also curious about, and I usually try not to duplicate the information that's already in the MongoDB docs.
