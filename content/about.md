I'm Asya Kamsky and I work [with](http://www.mongodb.org) and at [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com).

I've got many sites on the web that I contribute to, this is one where I'm
publishing many questions and answers about MongoDB that come up on mailing lists, [Google Groups], [Stackoverflow], and [live discussions].  

If you have a question you'd like me to answer, feel free to e-mail it to asya@mongodb.com and I will add it to the list.  I will tend to answer questions that others are also curious about, and I usually try not to duplicate the information that's already in the MongoDB docs.

If you need help/support based on your specific configuration/instances, it's best to post to MongoDB User Google Group, or file a support ticket if you have access to MongoDB commercial support.
