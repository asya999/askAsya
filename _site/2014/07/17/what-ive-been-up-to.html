<p>Title: What I’ve been up to
Date: 2014-07-17 08:17 </p>

<p>Hello readers:</p>

<p>I haven’t posted much lately because I was crazy busy with MongoDB World conference - it went really well and I will be posting some detailed analysis of some of the technical topics that I presented on.  </p>

<p>My talk on “Diagnostics and Debugging” which was focused on how to figure out what’s going on in your MongoDB cluster, especially when the performance has degraded.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://www.mongodb.com/presentations/diagnostics-and-debugging">a recording of it available on MongoDB.com website</a>, so what I’m going to do in the future here is give some more details about the tools that I described, as well as show complex debugging case(s) that I didn’t have the time to go through in the talk.</p>
