Title: What I've been up to
Date: 2014-07-17 08:17 

Hello readers:

I haven't posted much lately because I was crazy busy with MongoDB World conference - it went really well and I will be posting some detailed analysis of some of the technical topics that I presented on.  

My talk on "Diagnostics and Debugging" which was focused on how to figure out what's going on in your MongoDB cluster, especially when the performance has degraded.

There is [a recording of it available on MongoDB.com website][1], so what I'm going to do in the future here is give some more details about the tools that I described, as well as show complex debugging case(s) that I didn't have the time to go through in the talk.
